# Frontend Bootcamp Website - Bootstrap 5

> Simple one page website for a fake bootcamp. Bootstrap has been used via a CDN. Open the index.html file to see the webpage. Mapbox has been used for the map part. Bootstrap icons have also been used in the project via CDN. A random user API has also been used to get pics of random users. Nav bars, Accordion, Form elements, Img elements, Modals, etc have been used. Smooth scrolling works out of the box with bootstrap. The site has been created as a responsive site.
